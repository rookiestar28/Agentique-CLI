# Release Go/No-Go

Current source repository, published package registry pages, action usage, badge/readback documentation, and platform-link publication decision: **Go** for advertised channels.

The source repository is public. The public repository URL, package registry pages, action usage reference, badge/readback documentation, public documentation URL, schema URL base, `agentique.io` public URL, hosted CI evidence, branch protection evidence, and owner go/no-go approval are recorded.

Package registry pages, badge/readback documentation, and action usage documentation are approved after publication and smoke testing. GitHub Marketplace-style promotion remains a separate future channel.

`@agentique.io/uploader` is published on npm at version `0.1.0` after owner-approved publication, hosted Release Check evidence, registry readback, and clean install smoke. The package remains review-only; it does not publish, approve, certify, host, or moderate resources.

## Uploader Publication Decision

Current uploader publication decision: **Go** for npm package availability.

Reason: uploader source checks, package dry-run, owner-approved npm publication, hosted Release Check evidence, registry publish/readback, and clean install smoke from npm are complete.

Current blockers:

- None for npm package availability.

The uploader package page is approved for advertising. Authenticated review-session access and final resource publication remain platform-owned and account/token gated.

Current public-safe evidence is recorded in [release-evidence.md](release-evidence.md).

## Local Evidence

- Clean public baseline exists.
- Governance and review routing exist.
- Workflow posture check exists.
- Package dry-run check exists.
- Package registry publication and post-publish smoke evidence are recorded for `@agentique.io/schemas`, `@agentique.io/validator`, `@agentique.io/action`, `@agentique.io/readback`, and `@agentique.io/uploader`.
- Public URL inventory exists and now records approved advertised entries.
- Package tests, starter validation, release check, and dependency audits pass locally.
- Surfacing contract fixture matrix is covered by release checks.
- Readback helper docs describe context bundle and selection projections as read-only public projections.
- Hosted Release Check evidence is recorded for the latest pushed public release candidate; later branch changes require a fresh hosted run before downstream release claims.
- Public `main` branch protection is enabled.
- Final public URLs are approved.
- `agentique.io` public links are approved.
- Platform launch evidence required for public links is recorded.
- Owner go/no-go approval is recorded.

## Downstream Evidence

- Package registry URLs are advertised after publish and smoke testing.
- The uploader package URL is approved after registry readback and install smoke.
- Badge/readback documentation is advertised after readback package install/import smoke testing.
- Action usage documentation is advertised after repository workflow and package publication evidence.
- GitHub Marketplace-style promotion remains separate from this source/package release.

## Rollback And Unpublish Procedure

If a blocking issue is found after public release:

1. Stop additional publication.
2. Remove or disable affected public links.
3. Deprecate or replace affected package versions according to registry policy.
4. Disable affected badge or action examples.
5. Publish a public-safe correction note.
6. Keep sensitive details in the private disclosure or platform-owned support route.
7. Re-run release checks before restoring links.

Local validation does not approve publication or certify safety.

Public companion fixtures, uploader source output, and helper outputs do not make final resource decisions. They are baseline local evidence for owner review; `agentique.io` remains authoritative.
